    "1) Step 1: import all the modules/packages.\n",
    "2) Step 2: Run the first step and get the data,This data is stored in csv file.\n",
    "3) Step 3: Displaying the training labeled data.\n",
    "4) Step 4: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.\n",
    "5) Step 5:Load,Read and Clean Test Data\n",
    "6) Step 6: Tokenization\n",
